==========

A toolkit for making accessible web comics. (Well, it will be eventually!)

**Planned Primary Features**

* Screen-reader friendly!
* Semantic mark-up that could easily transform a graphic novel into a novel.
* Crisp, selectable, localizable, zoomable, styled text over top of empty image speech bubbles.
* Hidden descriptive text describing the scene and unspoken elements.
* Searchable, queryable, taggable, indexable, computable dialog.

**Planned Secondary Features**

* Tools to make adding text easy for comic creators.
* Supporting CMS for running a webcomic site.

**Longterm Goals**

* Make webcomics available to more people.
* Get existing web comics to make the switch.
